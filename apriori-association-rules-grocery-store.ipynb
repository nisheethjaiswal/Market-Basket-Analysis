    "<h1 style=\"color:forestgreen\" >Association Rules? What's that!</h1> \n",
    "\n",
    "Association rule learning is a rule-based machine learning method for discovering interesting relations between variables in large databases. It is intended to identify strong rules discovered in databases using some measures of interestingness.\n",
    "\n",
    "Based on the concept of strong rules, Rakesh Agrawal, Tomasz Imieliński and Arun Swam introduced association rules for discovering regularities between products in large-scale transaction data recorded by point-of-sale (POS) systems in supermarkets. For example, the rule {onions,potatoes} ->{burger} found in the sales data of a supermarket would indicate that if a customer buys onions and potatoes together, they are likely to also buy hamburger meat. Such information can be used as the basis for decisions about marketing activities such as, e.g., promotional pricing or product placements.\n",
    "\n",
    "In addition to the above example from market basket analysis association rules are employed today in many application areas including Web usage mining, intrusion detection, continuous production, and bioinformatics. In contrast with sequence mining, association rule learning typically does not consider the order of items either within a transaction or across transactions. [Wikipedia] \n",
    "\n",
    "First of all, we need to know some terms about Association Rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Support:** Support is an indication of how frequently the itemset appears in the dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "Support is a so-called frequency constraint. Its main feature is that it possesses the property of down-ward closure which means that all sub sets of a frequent set (support > min. support threshold) are also frequent. This property (actually, the fact that no super set of a infrequent set can be frequent) is used to prune the search space (usually a tree of item sets with increasing size) in level-wise algorithms (e.g., the APRIORI algorithm). The disadvantage of support is the rare item problem. Items that occur very infrequently in the data set are pruned although they would still produce interesting and potentially valuable rules.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Confidence:** Confidence is an indication of how often the rule has been found to be true.\n",
    "\n",
    "Confidence is not down-ward closed and was developed together with support (the so-called support-confidence framework). While support is used to prune the search space and only leave potentially interesting rules, confidence is used in a second step to filter rules that exceed a min. confidence threshold. A problem with confidence is that it is sensitive to the frequency of the consequent (Y) in the data set. Caused by the way confidence is calculated, Ys with higher support will automatically produce higher confidence values even if they exists no association between the items.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Lift:**  The ratio of the observed support to that expected if X and Y were independent.\n",
    "\n",
    "Leverage measures the difference of X and Y appearing together in the data set and what would be expected if X and Y where statistically dependent. The rational in a sales setting is to find out how many more units (items X and Y together) are sold than expected from the independent sells. Using min. leverage thresholds at the same time incorporates an implicit frequency constraint. E.g., for setting a min. leverage thresholds to 0.01% (corresponds to 10 occurrence in a data set with 100,000 transactions) one first can use an algorithm to find all itemsets with min. support of 0.01% and then filter the found item sets using the leverage constraint. Because of this property leverage also can suffer from the rare item problem.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Conviction:** The ratio of the expected frequency that X occurs without Y (that is to say, the frequency that the rule makes an incorrect prediction) if X and Y were independent divided by the observed frequency of incorrect predictions.\n",
    "\n",
    "Conviction compares the probability that X appears without Y if they were dependent with the actual frequency of the appearance of X without Y. In that respect it is similar to lift (see section about lift on this page), however, it contrast to lift it is a directed measure. Furthermore, conviction is monotone in confidence and lift.\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Leverage:** Leverage measures the difference of X and Y appearing together in the data set and what would be expected if X and Y where statistically dependent.\n",
